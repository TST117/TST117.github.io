        <p>
            I'm Shane, I have worked at UPS for almost 9 years. Half of that time has been in operations, the other half
            serving the organization in an I.T. or Data reporting capacity. I would love the opportunity to move into
            web development, and I have been waiting for a good time to make the jump. I believe this is a good
            opportunity to both continue learning about web development while putting the new skills to work.
